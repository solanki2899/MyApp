# MyApp
App designed by me

I am a beginner in Android Development and keenly interested in learning everything possible in it.
I have designed two apps for my college club named OSOC.
I have used different design format and schemes for them.

# MyApplication

It is designed using Material Design and used some Github repositories to make it more beautiful.
I have followed Material Design colour scheme guidelines to maintain the look and feel
It has Floating Button (Taken by Github repository 'com.getbase:floatingactionbutton:1.10.1') for my apps main menu.
It has my club's image and name as front page which is animated using blink animation file.
It has gorgeous look.
It has 6 Main Activities, 3 sub Activities, 1 Adapter file and 3 fragments.
It has beautiful looking background image (taken by google).
I have used Material cards for my app as basic layout which contain a linear layout to beautify the look.


# Problems in developing the app

### Material Design
I have never worked with Material Design earlier. So that took too much time to grasp the idea of it.

### Expandable card container
Initially for displaying grouped data, I used expandable card container ( taken by Github repository 'com.alespero:expandable-cardview:0.8').
It provides you the card container but don't allow you to make changes in it. Since it was not customizable and it has set maxlength attribute
to 1 which displays only 1 line of text , I have to change that card container.

### Tabbed Activity
To create it, i used tabbed activity which is created by me, i have not used predefined tabbed activity.
Designing part was easy but when it comes to Java, it was horrible to create PageAdapter and three tabs to inflate the respective layout.
I had tried it almost two days but i was unable to figure it out. Then i took help of youtube and watched a video to how to make tabbed
activity from scratch

### Custom Dialog Box

There are events cards containing logo and name. I have to display information about the events when image is clicked
i used custome dialog box for it
i have almost implementd all the things for it but on clicking second event image it was showing error as 'view is already in parent View'
after googling i found that i have to check for parent view. if it is already created then remove it and create new alert Dialog box.

### Animation

It may be easy for others to make custom animations but for me it was nightmare at that time.
When i tried it initially i got lots of errors but after googling, reading android developer guide and youtube, it got the point and made
my animations in xml file.


### New key topics i learnt while making the app

- Material Design
- Animation
- Fonts
- Card container
- Custom Dialog Box

- Tabbed Activity
- Efficient use of Nested Scrollbar Layout
